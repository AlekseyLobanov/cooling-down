# cooling-down
Research of cooling water in 5 different containers.

## Requirements
1. Python
2. Matplolib
3. numpy
4. scipy

## Using
Just run
```
python process.py
```
It will calculate coefficients from
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_cooling).
Also you get a vector chart, like this:

## Conclusions
Mug cap is great. But even without it mug thermos is
significantly better than others.

And if you have another normal mug, it almost does not affect the cooling.
